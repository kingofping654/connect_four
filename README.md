This project was essentially to learn Rspec and test driven development as a whole. It was an interesting project learning how to do test driven development. I don't know if it is 100% what I like doing but I see the benefits. It does feel very good to pass all of the tests you wrote. This project went fairly smoothly for most of the time until I had to write win conditions. Vertical and Horizontal wins were easy to do but diagonal wins took me some time to figure out. I actually originally wrote the game without implementing the need for a token to have a token below it or be in the bottom row. It didn't take long to implement but I thought it really slowed things down especially when testing. This is likely the most difficult game I have adapted but by the end I think it turned out well. Especially because I didn't even look up any answers.
